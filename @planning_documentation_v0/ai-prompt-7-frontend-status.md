# AI Prompt 7: Frontend Scaffolding — Status & Implementation Update

## Status
- **Main feed page scaffolded:** `src/app/(feed)/page.tsx` — Lists story clusters with articles, uses React Query and Shadcn UI.
- **Story detail page scaffolded:** `src/app/(story)/[clusterId]/page.tsx` — Shows a single story cluster, its articles, comments, and consensus notes. Includes comment form and consensus display.
- **Auth pages scaffolded:**
  - `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` — Login form (Shadcn UI), error/loading states, link to register.
  - `src/app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` — Register form (Shadcn UI), error/loading states, link to login.

## Implementation Details
- All pages use Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Data fetching and mutation handled with React Query.
- Loading and error states shown for all async operations.
- TypeScript interfaces for all data models.
- Auth forms are ready for Supabase integration.

## Next Steps
- Integrate Supabase Auth for login/register flows.
- Add user context and protected routes.
- Polish UI/UX, add profile and settings pages as needed.
- Begin end-to-end testing and bugfixing.
