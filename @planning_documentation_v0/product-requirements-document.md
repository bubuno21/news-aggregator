# News Aggregator with Crowdsourced Bias Insights
## Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview

The product is an unbiased news aggregation platform that collects all English-language news stories without any bias-based filtering at the ingestion stage. Every news article from across the spectrum is aggregated and grouped by story, ensuring multiple sources for the same event are presented together. On top of this neutral aggregation, the platform provides a crowdsourced commentary system to highlight biases and consensus in coverage.

Users can contribute short comments or notes on news stories, and an algorithmic system (inspired by tools like Pol.is and Twitter's Community Notes) analyzes these contributions to surface summarized insights from diverse perspectives. The platform does not hide bias in content â€“ instead, it highlights bias explicitly through community input and patterns of agreement/disagreement.

## 2. Goals

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aggregate all English-language news stories in one place, giving users a one-stop destination for news without partisan filtering.
- **Transparency in Bias**: Expose and highlight potential biases in news coverage through visible community comments and consensus insights, rather than filtering biased content out.
- **Diverse Perspectives & Consensus**: Encourage a broad range of viewpoints and use algorithms to identify points of agreement across different ideological clusters, prioritizing cross-cluster consensus as valuable insight.
- **User Engagement and Trust**: Allow readers to actively engage (vote, comment) on news stories, increasing trust through community validation and collaborative fact-checking.
- **Story Deduplication**: Group multiple articles about the same story or event together, reducing duplicate content and focusing discussion on the story level rather than individual articles.

## 3. Use Cases

### 3.1. General News Reader
A user visits the platform to catch up on current events. They see top stories with multiple source articles listed under each story. The user can read a summary of community insights highlighting if different political groups view the story differently or if there are any consensus notes agreeing on key facts. This helps the reader get a more balanced understanding of the news.

### 3.2. Bias Explorer
A user suspicious of media bias wants to see how various outlets cover a controversial topic. They use the platform to read several versions of the story from different sources side by side. In the crowdsourced comments section, they see clusters of opinions and a highlighted comment that multiple clusters agreed on, indicating a common ground point.

### 3.3. Contributing User (Registered)
A passionate reader registers an account to participate. They come across a story and notice missing context or bias. They add a constructive comment providing additional context. Other users vote on this comment's helpfulness. The system algorithm detects that users from different voting clusters find the comment helpful, so it boosts this comment as a "Community Consensus Note" at the top of the discussion.

### 3.4. Anonymous Browser
An unregistered visitor browses headlines and community insights without logging in. They cannot vote or comment, but they benefit from the aggregated news and the visible crowd commentary that flags diverse perspectives. If they find the feature useful, they may choose to sign up to contribute themselves.

## 4. Solution Components

- Focuses on relevance (newsworthiness, recency) rather than ideological filtering

#### 4.1.2. Story Clustering & Deduplication
- Automated clustering algorithm groups articles reporting on the same story or event
- Uses Natural Language Processing (semantic similarity and entity/event detection)
- Groups all related articles under a single story entry

#### 4.1.3. Neutral Presentation
- Stories presented sorted by time, importance/trending, or user-selected topics
- No source suppression or prioritization for ideological reasons
- Users can filter by category or search for topics

#### 4.1.4. Full Content Access

- Click through to read full articles on original publishers' sites (or within app if licensed)
- Shows snippets or summaries with credit and traffic back to publishers for full articles

### 4.2. Crowdsourcing & Bias Exploration Component

#### 4.2.1. Crowdsourced Comments
- Users can contribute comments, context notes, or fact-checks below each story cluster
- Comments are short and focused, highlighting bias, providing context, or pointing out consensus facts
- Visibility and order determined algorithmically rather than by simple upvote count

#### 4.2.2. Behavioral Clustering of Users
- System analyzes user interactions with comments
- Automatically sorts users (and their comments) into clusters of like-minded perspective
- Clusters generated without asking for personal bias info

#### 4.2.3. Algorithmic Consensus Detection
- Comment ranking algorithm identifies comments that receive positive votes from users across different clusters
- Cross-cluster consensus comments prioritized at the top of the discussion
- Highlights points of agreement that bridge ideological divides

#### 4.2.4. Transparent Perspective Highlights
- Comments displayed with indicators reflecting support within each cluster
- Users can toggle views to see top comments within each cluster
- Default view emphasizes consensus comments that transcend clusters

#### 4.2.5. Voting Mechanism
- Registered users can vote on comments as Helpful/Agree or Not Helpful/Disagree
- Community's aggregated behavior drives visibility, not manual moderation
- New users' votes/comments carry less weight until they've gained trust

#### 4.2.6. User Contributions and Summaries
- Users can write new comments to add missing context or point out bias
- System may prompt consolidated summaries for common issues
- Each news story accompanied by a dynamic, community-generated "context panel"
