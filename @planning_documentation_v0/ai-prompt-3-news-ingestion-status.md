# AI Prompt 3: News Ingestion Service — Status & Implementation Update

## Status
- **Poller implemented:** `src/services/ingestion/poller.ts` — Periodically fetches news articles from NewsAPI and upserts them into Supabase.
- **Parser/Normalizer implemented:** `src/services/ingestion/parser.ts` — Provides normalization for raw NewsAPI articles to the internal format.
- **NewsAPI fetcher exists:** `src/services/ingestion/newsapi.ts` — Fetches and normalizes articles from NewsAPI.

## Implementation Details
- The poller runs every 10 minutes (configurable) and upserts articles by URL to avoid duplicates.
- The parser ensures all required fields are present and standardized for storage.
- All ingestion logic is modular for future source expansion.

## Next Steps
- Integrate parser into poller for explicit normalization (if not already).
- Expand poller to support multiple queries or sources.
- Add error handling, logging, and metrics as needed.
- Begin work on clustering worker (`src/services/clustering/worker.ts`).
